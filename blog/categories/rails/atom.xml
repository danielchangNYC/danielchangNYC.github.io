    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What&rsquo;s a Matcher?</h2>

<p><code>expect(dan.current_zipcode).to eq(10002)</code></p>

<p>In the line above, the <code>matcher</code> is the method <code>eq</code> because RSpec will check to see if the value of <code>dan.current_zipcode</code> matches <code>10002</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that this was a line you wrote for as part of a test for a location tracking app. You want your code to be as clear as possible for collaborators or even for your future self.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it sound even better if you could write this?</p>

<p><code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code></p>

<p>This requires <code>be_in_zipcode</code> to be a method in <code>RSpec</code>&rsquo;s matcher library. I&rsquo;m going to briefly explain how to create this new matcher, but for alternate explanations, check out the <a href="https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Custom-Matchers">Rspec Github Wiki</a> and Chapter 7 of Aaron Sumner&rsquo;s <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>My intention is not to write another Matcher tutorial (though this might inevitably happen). After reading Sumner&rsquo;s chapter, I could imagine how matchers were created but ultimately, I felt a bit uncertain. With a little bit of <code>Pry</code> magic and doc-digging, I think I&rsquo;ve finally put most of the puzzle together which I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing below! Constructive feedback and deeper insights are always welcome. :)</p>

<h2>Match-Maker, Match-Maker, Make Me a Match!</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write some code so that we can use the method <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> from above.</p>

<p>General syntax at bare minimum first:
``` ruby syntax.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :new_matcher_name do |expected|
  match do |actual|</p>

<pre><code># Lines of code you want this matcher to run
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  #optional description and failure message definition blocks
end</p>

<h1>From the describe block:</h1>

<h1>expect(actual).to matcher_method(expected)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>NOTE: Store your matcher files in <code>spec/support/matchers/</code> and require them in <code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code> with the following line:</p>

<p><code>Dir[File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/support/**/*.rb"].each {|f| require f}</code></p>

<p>Now onto our example:
``` ruby be_in_zipcode.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|
  match do |friend|</p>

<pre><code>friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # Optional failure messages
  failure_message_for_should do |actual|</p>

<pre><code>"expected friend to be in zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  failure_message_for_should_not do |actual|</p>

<pre><code>"expected friend not to be in zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # Optional method description
  description do</p>

<pre><code>"checks user's current zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Again, the failure messages and description are optional blocks. The match block is obviously mandatory. So now that we have our new matcher, let&rsquo;s check out what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Under the hood</h2>

<p><code>RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|</code></p>

<p>The <code>define</code> method, extended from the DSL module, does the following:</p>

<p>``` ruby define.rb RSpec::Matchers::DSL#define
def define(name, &amp;declarations)
  matcher_template = RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher.new(name, &amp;declarations)
  define_method name do |*expected|    # => expected for us is the var zipcode</p>

<pre><code>matcher = matcher_template.for_expected(*expected)
matcher.matcher_execution_context = @matcher_execution_context ||= self
matcher
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>name = be_in_zipcode</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The second line setting <code>matcher_template</code> initializes an <code>RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher</code> object which stores the method name and the declarations block.</p>

<p><code>define_method</code> then creates the <code>be_in_zipcode</code> method. The next line&rsquo;s <code>for_expected(*expected)</code> method sets the zipcode as the expected value and your failure messages/description from the matcher template in the second line. The messages and description are stored in the @messages attribute hash.</p>

<p>The next line I&rsquo;m not sure about since <code>matcher_execution_context</code> refers to an attribute accessor. I don&rsquo;t see it in the Matcher module either. Any insight here would be great!</p>

<p>Moving onto the last piece: the match block.</p>

<p>``` ruby
  match do |friend|</p>

<pre><code>friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p><code>RSpec::Match#match</code> stores the given block in <code>@match_block</code>, so essentially, <code>@match_block = friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)</code>.</p>

<p>Later, when you run your specs with the new matcher, the <code>match_block</code> will get called from the method <code>RSpec::Match#matches?</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby matches?
def matches?(actual)
  @actual = actual
  if @expected_exception</p>

<pre><code>begin
  instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
  true
rescue @expected_exception
  false
end
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>begin
  instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
rescue Spec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError
  false
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>So if I were to run the original line, <code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code>, the following would happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>expect(dan)</code> returns an <code>RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget</code> object storing the object <code>dan</code>.
<code>`` ruby pry_session
</code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)`</li>
</ol>


<h1>=> #&lt;RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget:0x007fbf511e4c78 @target=#<User id: 1, name: dan>></h1>

<p>```</p>

<ol>
<li>the <code>to</code> method passes in <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> and calls a method called <code>handle_matcher</code>&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; which checks if <code>be_in_zipcode</code> has been defined as a matcher.</li>
<li>Since we&rsquo;ve defined <code>be_in_zipcode</code>, <code>matches?</code> gets called our block, which we saw above.</li>
<li><code>handle_matcher</code> then figures out how to respond, given the messages you passed in when you defined the new matcher.</li>
</ol>


<p>&hellip; And that&rsquo;s our deep dive into RSpec&rsquo;s Custom Matchers. Again, feedback always welcome. Hope you enjoyed the complexity as much as I did! :)</p>

    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/01/13/tdd1-ActiveRecordEqualityRogue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85629/1887574-rogue1.gif">http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85629/1887574-rogue1.gif</a>" title="Rogue" >
Almost done with my model specs! I ran into a couple of interesting problems that I posted on Stack Overflow, one of which I&rsquo;ll cover briefly below. Oh yeah, and Rogue! I&rsquo;ll explain that in the last section of this post.</p>

<h2>The problem I ran into (from my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21102549/why-is-the-where-query-in-rails-returning-a-different-object">StackOverflow post</a>)</h2>

<p><em>If you just read the whole post, skip to the last section of this blog post.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m testing chats between users in my app. I&rsquo;m using RSpec and FactoryGirl</p>

<p>The test that&rsquo;s not passing:</p>

<p><code>ruby chat_spec.rb
it "creates a chat if one does not exist" do
  bob = create(:user, username: "bob")
  dan = create(:user, username: "dan")
  new_chat = Chat.create(user_id: dan.id, chatted_user_id: bob.id)
  expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)
end
</code></p>

<p>The failure message says:</p>

<p>``` sh
Failure/Error: expect(Chat.where(&ldquo;chatted_user_id = ?&rdquo;, bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)</p>

<p>   expected #&lt;Chat:70120833243920> => #<Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3></p>

<pre><code>    got #&lt;Chat:70120833276240&gt; =&gt; #&lt;Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>   Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,
   but expected and actual are not the same object. Use
   <code>expect(actual).to eq(expected)</code> if you don&rsquo;t care about
   object identity in this example.
```</p>

<p>Why is my query returning a different object id?</p>

<h3>Answer from Simone Carletti on StackOverflow</h3>

<p>equal checks object identity. The objects you are testing are two objects (instances) referencing the same record, but they are actually different objects from a Ruby virtual machine point of view.</p>

<p>You should use
<code>ruby
expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to eq(new_chat)
</code>
To better understand the problem, look at the following example</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :001 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320944040
2.0.0-p353 :002 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320962820
</code>
Here I&rsquo;m creating two identical strings. They are identical, but not equal because they are actually two different objects.</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :008 &gt; "foo" == "foo"
 =&gt; true
2.0.0-p353 :009 &gt; "foo".equal? "foo"
 =&gt; false
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the same issue affecting your test. equal checks if two objects are actually the same at the object_id level. But what you really want to know is if they are the same record.</p>

<h2>So what&rsquo;s happening under the hood?</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;where&rdquo; query returns an array of objects matching the query, and those objects must be Active Record objects that just handle the data. If I make another query, Active Record must be creating another set of objects to handle each row of data.</p>

<p>I wanted to confirm this before throwing it out on the web as &ldquo;fact&rdquo;, so here&rsquo;s what an Active Record object is from <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Martin Fowler himself</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think of an Active Record object sort of like Rogue (see above). For those of you who don&rsquo;t remember, Rogue absorbs the memories and abilities of any person she touches.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/25cd14bae1b207202d0ee9b56b475409/tumblr_mzd6fjLYmf1sqhdy2o1_1280.png">http://31.media.tumblr.com/25cd14bae1b207202d0ee9b56b475409/tumblr_mzd6fjLYmf1sqhdy2o1_1280.png</a>" width="480" title="Comic Picture Rogue&rsquo;s Powers" ></p>

<p>Similarly (sorta), an Active Record objects takes the data (memories) of a certain row and then takes on the behavior (abilities) of the object type matching the table name.</p>

<p>Ok, so that was really just an excuse to get Rogue somewhere on my blog. While I&rsquo;m at it, here&rsquo;s one of her destroying Ororo (Storm).</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b310/RogueX18/Rogue%20Absorptions/UncannyX-Men158Storm.jpg">http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b310/RogueX18/Rogue%20Absorptions/UncannyX-Men158Storm.jpg</a>" title="Rogue and Storm Picture" ></p>

<p>So there you have it! Moral of the story: generally remember to use eq to test equivalence in RSpec with ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/2-0/docs/matchers/equality-matchers">bonus resource: equal, eql, eq, and ==</a> in RSpec.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-12T23:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/01/12/tdd0-whyttd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing is one of those things that feels a bit like eating well or going to the gym. Since it&rsquo;s already ten days into the New Year and I have yet to commit to any resolutions, let this be it: no more will I make excuses for skipping testing.</p>

<p>What does this really mean to me though? Am I eating broccoli just because someone told me it&rsquo;s good for me? Here are three reasons that have driven me to make the change.</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 1: Manual Testing Sucks; TDD Saves Time</h2>

<p>My friend told me about the job she left before coming to the Flatiron School and one of her responsibilities looked a bit like this:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://blog.polarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-12.07.14-PM.png">http://blog.polarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-12.07.14-PM.png</a>"></p>

<p>What. A. Nightmare. There should be a -phobia for this.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &mdash; I&rsquo;m sure this could be pretty efficient if the scope of the UX is very small, or you don&rsquo;t know-how to implement TDD yet. However, how can you be sure your site won&rsquo;t expand, or why not learn how to use a gem like Capybara to save you time in the future? Used in conjuction with Guard, you could really save some serious time while coding!</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 2: Code Confidence</h2>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had a bit more experience writing web apps (still without TDD), I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of seeing them grow and change throughout development. On the other hand, everytime I implemented a new feature, I had less and less confidence that the rest of my code base would work fine. At some point, the prospect of a new feature started feeling like a laundry list or the guarantee of a new bug. Testing will certainly help me find bugs as I introduce them, and therefore boost my confidence in in my code.</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 3: Thinking Before Doing</h2>

<p>Writing tests before writing production code forces you to clearly iterate what it is you want your application to do before you start coding. Ideally, you want your tests to last as long as possible as well, so it will force you to make important decisions about design as well. The prospect of having well thought-out code with lasting design excites me! I&rsquo;ve had several experiences already of trying to refactor poorly designed code and it&rsquo;s quite painful.</p>

<h2>My Next Steps</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to begin my TDD exploration by refactoring my first app, Little Red Wagon (LRW). My current reads are Aaron Sumner&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz. I&rsquo;m about 30% through each book right now and have written a few model specs already for LRW. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Factory Girl since it will slow down testing and Rails' built-in fixtures are satisfactory for what I currently have. In any case, the grand plan is to get some hands-on practice writing tests using the TDD book first and then taking on the much larger challenge of redesigning my code base. Thanks for reading, and more updates to come on TDD!</p>

    <updated>2013-11-06T08:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2013/11/06/self-referential-associations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 2 of learning Rails. After 6 weeks at Flatiron, I feel like a beginner again, but not quite like I&rsquo;m stranded on a deserted island &mdash; more like I&rsquo;m Link, and although I wield a wooden sword, new items abound and I&rsquo;m eager to learn how to use them.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.ohmz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this.jpg">http://www.ohmz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this.jpg</a>" width="400"></p>

<p>Although the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a> have been invaluable, trying new constructs myself is how I internalize a concept. This blog post will be about <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html">associations</a>, particularly <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#self-joins">self joins</a>.</p>

<h2>Mini-Project: Self-Joins</h2>

<p>I created a basic rails app and deployed it on Heroku <a href="https://customer-referrals-testsite.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Try it out to see how the customer data behaves. Imagine what the schema (or &ldquo;table&rdquo;) might look like and then read on.</p>

<h1>What is a Self Join?</h1>

<p>Below is a self-join. While foreign keys are usually used to link data between two tables, you can use foreign keys to refer to data within the <em>same</em> table to create one that looks something like this:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/538_sql3/ss_5.png">http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/538_sql3/ss_5.png</a>" width="600">
<a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/databases/sql-for-beginners-part-3-database-relationships/">(source site)</a></p>

<p>I originally tried the following associations below.
<code>ruby customer.rb BROKEN VERSION
class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :referrals, class_name: "Customer", foreign_key: "referring_customer_id", conditions: {:referring_customer_id =&gt; :id}
  belongs_to :referring_customer, class_name: "Customer", foreign_key: "referring_customer_id"
end
</code>
This didn&rsquo;t work. After some serious research, stackoverflow, posting my own <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19803759/how-do-i-create-a-self-referential-association-self-join-in-a-single-class-usi">stackoverflow question</a> (thanks Peter!!!), trial-and-error, and pry sessions, I refactored my code to:
<code>ruby customer.rb WORKING VERSION
class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :referrals, class_name: "Customer", foreign_key: "referring_customer_id"
  belongs_to :referring_customer, class_name: "Customer"
end
</code>
Let&rsquo;s think about this for a second. Why does this work and what does it do? <code>has_many</code> and <code>belongs_to</code> provide <code>Customer</code>s with a set of methods to access their associated data. The options passed often do not change the database since Rails tries to keep logic defined within the application. Why? I&rsquo;m not exactly sure but I suppose this is partially why Rails easily supports a wide range of databases.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the arguments do:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>class_name: "Customer"</code> tells Rails to look in the <code>Customer</code> class for the association. What do I mean by association? In <code>has_many :referrals</code>, the <code>:referrals</code> is called the assocation. When would I use this? When I need to override the Rails convention for identifying the class in which to find the association.</li>
<li><code>foreign_key: "referring_customer_id"</code> tells Rails where to find the foreign key. When would I use this? When I need to override the Rails convention for identifying the class in which to find the association. Why didn&rsquo;t I use it for <code>belongs_to</code>? It is implicitly defined with that method.</li>
<li><code>conditions: "referring_customer_id = id"</code> actually fires a <code>WHERE</code> SQL statement with the given value. I originally used this thinking it would match referring customers by their id. It turned out to be an extra constraint though &mdash; <code>AND (referring_customer_id = id)</code> &mdash; which filtered for any customer who referred <em>him/herself</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>When else can I use self-joins?</h1>

<p>Generally you can use self-joins anytime you need to create a hierarchy-like, &ldquo;nested&rdquo; structure.
<img class="right <a" src="href="http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/538_sql3/graph_5.png">http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/538_sql3/graph_5.png</a>" width="400"></p>

<p>Some other applications could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating parent and child directories for Folder objects.</li>
<li>Creating managers and subordinates for Employee objects.</li>
<li>Creating callers and receivers for PhoneTreeMember objects.</li>
<li>Anything else with a parent-child data relationship.</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Master Sword!</h1>

<p>Just when you thought THAT was exciting, there are also plenty of <em>GEMS</em> that allow you to create these nested structures! Two from the Ruby Toolbox are <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/awesome_nested_set">Awesome Nested Set</a> and <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/ancestry">Ancestry</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-08T07:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2013/10/08/rails-presentation-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took a bit of a dive today and looked a Ruby on Rails <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aizatto/ruby-on-rails-48391">presentation</a>. Here&rsquo;s what I gleaned from looking through all the slides.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rails is a web application framework that allows your Ruby to interact with the web seamlessly. By &ldquo;interact with the web&rdquo;, I assume the presentation means &ldquo;interact with databases.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Rails implements a principle called &ldquo;MVC&rdquo; &mdash; Model View Controller. Rails seems to handle each task separately. I&rsquo;m going to focus on the Model, which uses ActiveRecord.</p></li>
<li><p>ActiveRecord is a Module that Rails uses to model and interact with databases. It makes database queries both simple and intuitive.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here are some concrete query comparisons between using SQLite3 versus Rails' ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Assume we have a table called &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; each with a name, age, weight, and type. Each attribute would be a column, and each row would represent a different dog.</p>

<p><code>sql Table using SQLite3
CREATE TABLE dogs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT;
  age INTEGER;
  weight INTEGER;
  type TEXT
);
</code>
We can also imagine this as a class of Dog objects in Ruby. Here&rsquo;s how one might create the barebones structure in Ruby.
<code>ruby Dogs as objects of class Dog in Ruby
class Dog
  attr_accessor :id, :name, :age, :weight, :type
end
</code>
<code>ruby Table initialized using Rails' ActiveRecord
class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</code></p>

<p>See how simple that was? Now we can make queries on the table.</p>

<p><code>sql SQLite3 query for first dog in table
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE id=1;
</code>
<code>ruby Rails query for first dog in table
Dog.find(1)
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning! Check this out.</p>

<p><code>sql SQLite3 query appending conditions
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age=8 AND type="corgi";
