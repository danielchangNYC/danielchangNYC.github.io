    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on the <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School pre-work</a> progress-tracker, I kept finding myself feeling uncomfortable with the <code>topic_complete?</code> and <code>add_lesson</code> methods below.</p>

<h1 id="code-smell-topiccomplete-and-addlesson">Code Smell: <code>topic_complete?</code> and <code>add_lesson</code></h1>

<p>``` ruby
class Progress &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :topic
  serialize :completed_lessons, Array</p>

<p>def topic_complete?
    topic.total_lessons == completed_lessons.length
  end
end</p>

<p>class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :progresses
  serialize :lesson_order, Array</p>

<p>def add_lesson(lesson)
    lesson_order « lesson.id
    total_lessons += 1
  end
end
```</p>

<h1 id="why-the-code-is-smelly">Why The Code Is Smelly</h1>

<p><code>add_lesson</code> felt brittle. A new coder on this project has to know to add lessons using this method; the design is therefore NOT transparent. There is also a duplication of data: the <code>total_lessons</code> attribute and the length of the <code>lesson_order</code> array should always be the same, so why do we need <code>total_lessons</code>? The code therefore violates the DRY principle.</p>

<p><code>topic_complete?</code> has another host of what-if situations. Consider the possibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An admin removes lessons from the topic. <code>topic_complete?</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
  <li>An admin replaces a lesson in the topic. <code>topic_complete?</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
  <li><code>total_lessons</code> doesn’t get updated using <code>add_lesson</code>. See above.</li>
</ul>

<p>I needed a way to actually compare what was in the two arrays, <code>completed_lessons</code> and <code>lesson_order</code>.</p>

<h1 id="an-unlikely-but-elegant-solution">An Unlikely But Elegant Solution</h1>

<p>I considered iterating through <code>lesson_order</code> and comparing with <code>completed_lessons</code>, but this seemed cumbersome; “There must be an easier way,” thought Daniel.</p>

<p>Then it hit me: this is a <strong>set intersection</strong> problem. (Duh, it’s in the title!)</p>

<p>Set theory review: The intersection of two sets is the set of all common elements. Luckily, Ruby class Array has such a method which can be used like an operator: <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<h1 id="solution-1--fail">Solution 1 =&gt; #fail</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Array.html#method-i-26">&amp; operator</a> is called the set intersection operator.</p>

<p><code>ruby example
[ 1, 1, 3, 5 ] &amp; [ 1, 2, 3 ]    #=&gt; [ 1, 3 ]
</code></p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def topic_complete?
  completed_lessons &amp; topic.lesson_order == topic.lesson_order
end
</code></p>

<p>…which failed.</p>

<h1 id="why-solution-1-failed">Why Solution 1 Failed</h1>

<p>``` ruby irb-fiddling
lesson_order = [3, 2, 5]
completed_lessons = [5, 2, 3]</p>

<p>lesson_order &amp; completed_lessons
   # =&gt; [3, 2, 5]</p>

<p>completed_lessons &amp; lesson_order
   # =&gt; [5, 2, 3]</p>

<p>completed_lessons &amp; lesson_order == lesson_order
   # =&gt; false
```</p>

<p>Note: <code>&amp;</code> ignores doubles.</p>

<p>``` ruby
a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
b = [2, 2, 2]</p>

<p>a &amp; b
  # =&gt; [2]</p>

<p>b &amp; a
  # =&gt; [2]
```</p>

<h1 id="solution-2-ob">Solution 2: o(^_^)b</h1>

<p><code>ruby
def topic_complete?
  topic.lesson_order &amp; completed_lessons == topic.lesson_order
end
</code>
“Huzzah!” thought Daniel.</p>

<h1 id="bonus-how-does--work">BONUS: How Does <code>#&amp;</code> Work?</h1>

<p>I took a a deep dive into Ruby source code to figure this one out.</p>

<p>Here’s the code in C.</p>

<p>``` c
 static VALUE
rb_ary_and(VALUE ary1, VALUE ary2)
{
    VALUE hash, ary3, v;
    st_table *table;
    st_data_t vv;
    long i;</p>

<pre><code>ary2 = to_ary(ary2);
ary3 = rb_ary_new();
if (RARRAY_LEN(ary2) == 0) return ary3;
hash = ary_make_hash(ary2);
table = rb_hash_tbl_raw(hash);

for (i=0; i&lt;RARRAY_LEN(ary1); i++) {
    v = RARRAY_AREF(ary1, i);
    vv = (st_data_t)v;
    if (st_delete(table, &amp;vv, 0)) {
        rb_ary_push(ary3, v);
    }
}
ary_recycle_hash(hash);

return ary3; } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Full disclosure: I’ve never read or written C in my life, but with the help of the <a href="http://rxr.whitequark.org/mri/ident">MRI Identifier Search</a>, I was able to piece together what this does.</p>

<p>The key to understanding this is in the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p><code>ary1</code> and <code>ary2</code> represent the arrays for which we’re finding the intersection. <code>ary3</code> is what the function <code>rb_ary_and</code> returns.</p>

<p>v represents <code>ary1[i]</code>, in Ruby-speak.
vv is somehow tied to that value.</p>

<p><code>st_delete</code> returns 1 if <code>vv</code> was successfully deleted from <code>table</code>, which really refers to <code>ary2</code>, and 0 if it wasn’t found. If it gets deleted, then that means <code>ary2</code> must have had an element in common; push that element into <code>ary3</code>.</p>

<h1 id="so-how-efficient-is-this-method">So how efficient is this method?</h1>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, <code>ary1</code> and <code>ary2</code> are giant arrays with completely disparate elements, requiring the algorithm to compare all elements of <code>ary2</code> with all elements of <code>ary1</code>. Given there are <em>x</em> elements in <code>ary1</code> and <em>y</em> elements in <code>ary2</code>, this would produce a O(x*y).</p>

    <link href="http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/04/08/tdd3-TestingHooks/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-08T09:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/04/08/tdd3-TestingHooks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who’s worked with tightly-coupled models in rails will likely know the pain of tracing the stack for an error triggered from a callback method. Such painful experiences have led developers to come to a consensus on general rules like <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1658-the-only-acceptable-use-for-callbacks-in-rails-ever/">“Use a callback only when the logic refers to state internal to the object”</a>, according to Jonathan Wallace. More on this topic by Samuel Mullen in a great blogpost, <a href="http://www.samuelmullen.com/2013/05/the-problem-with-rails-callbacks/">The Problem with Rails Callbacks</a>.</p>

<p>The following post revolves around an <code>Invitation</code> model I wrote with my team mates and then later debated the callback to use.</p>

<p>The <code>Invitation</code> model generates a unique token which it uses to identify users who have clicked on a registration link.</p>

<p>The callback I chose to use first was <code>after_initialize</code> because an <code>invite</code> object must always have a <code>token</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation.rb
class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  after initialize :add_token #NOTE my syntax highlighter dislikes the underscore. see below.</p>

<p>def add_unique_token
    self.token = Tokenizer.Generate
  end
end
```</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <code>after initialize</code> above should be <code>after_initialize</code>. For some reason my syntax highlighting plugin doesn’t like the underscore in the correct version.</p>

<p>The associated test:</p>

<p><code>ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it "generates a random token on initialize" do
    invite = Invitation.new
    expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>However, another team mate suggested using <code>before_create</code> instead.</p>

<p>His model and test:</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation.rb
class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  before_create :add_token</p>

<p>def add_unique_token
    self.token = Tokenizer.generate
  end
end
```</p>

<p><code>ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it "generates a random token before create" do
    invite = Invitation.new
    expect(invite.token).to be_nil
    invite.save
    expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
  end
end
</code></p>

<h3 id="why-does-this-subtle-change-matter">Why does this subtle change matter?</h3>

<p>First, <strong>using <code>after_initialize</code> could produce a false positive.</strong> While the <code>after_initialize</code> test does exactly what the <code>it</code> statement says, there’s a chance that we may miss, say, a validation error that happens before <code>save</code>. This test would pass, and so would the validations, but for some reason you might find that your invitations aren’t working properly. <code>after_initialize</code> allows us to omit saving from the test, which one could generally assume is always desired given that callbacks should only “refer to state internal to an object”.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>if you’re testing a callback that affects the internal state of an object, we must test for a state-change.</strong> Using <code>after_initialize</code>, we can tell that a new invite has a token. However, we cannot say that we’ve tested the non-presence and the presence of the token. The pivotal point again is around <code>#save</code>. <code>#save</code> triggers the change and we can say with certainty that we’ve not only seen a “zero to one” change happen, but that the change has persisted in our database.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/scottadhoc/status/453917228648640512">Twitter comment</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/scottadhoc">@scottadhoc</a>: “what happens if you load that record from the db into a new object and then assert on that field?”</p>

<p>Good point! If I understand your suggestion correctly, here’s how I might refactor the after_initialize version of the spec:</p>

<p><code>ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it "generates a random token #after_initialize" do
    invite = Invitation.new
    expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
    invite.save!
    expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>This way, we can make sure that the data persisted. While this works, my feeling is that the implication of testing after_initialize allows one to omit the persistence part. I certainly fell into that trap and wouldn’t be surprised if I forget again while testing an after_initialize callback.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you use <code>after_initialize</code> with the underscore in a block of code in <code>Octopress</code>, your blog will refuse to generate. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-15T06:40:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/01/15/tdd2-RSpecMatchers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="whats-a-matcher">What’s a Matcher?</h1>

<p><code>expect(dan.current_zipcode).to eq(10002)</code></p>

<p>In the line above, the <code>matcher</code> is the method <code>eq</code> because RSpec will check to see if the value of <code>dan.current_zipcode</code> matches <code>10002</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s say that this was a line you wrote for as part of a test for a location tracking app. You want your code to be as clear as possible for collaborators or even for your future self.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it sound even better if you could write this?</p>

<p><code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code></p>

<p>This requires <code>be_in_zipcode</code> to be a method in <code>RSpec</code>’s matcher library. I’m going to briefly explain how to create this new matcher, but for alternate explanations, check out the <a href="https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Custom-Matchers">Rspec Github Wiki</a> and Chapter 7 of Aaron Sumner’s <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>My intention is not to write another Matcher tutorial (though this might inevitably happen). After reading Sumner’s chapter, I could imagine how matchers were created but ultimately, I felt a bit uncertain. With a little bit of <code>Pry</code> magic and doc-digging, I think I’ve finally put most of the puzzle together which I’m looking forward to sharing below! Constructive feedback and deeper insights are always welcome. :)</p>

<h1 id="match-maker-match-maker-make-me-a-match">Match-Maker, Match-Maker, Make Me a Match!</h1>

<p>Let’s write some code so that we can use the method <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> from above.</p>

<p>General syntax at bare minimum first:
``` ruby syntax.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :new_matcher_name do |expected|
  match do |actual|
    # Lines of code you want this matcher to run
  end</p>

<p>#optional description and failure message definition blocks
end</p>

<h1 id="from-the-describe-block">From the describe block:</h1>
<p># expect(actual).to matcher_method(expected)
```</p>

<p>NOTE: Store your matcher files in <code>spec/support/matchers/</code> and require them in <code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code> with the following line:</p>

<p><code>Dir[File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/support/**/*.rb"].each {|f| require f}</code></p>

<p>Now onto our example:
``` ruby be_in_zipcode.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|
  match do |friend|
    friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
  end</p>

<p># Optional failure messages
  failure_message_for_should do |actual|
    “expected friend to be in zipcode”
  end</p>

<p>failure_message_for_should_not do |actual|
    “expected friend not to be in zipcode”
  end</p>

<p># Optional method description
  description do
    “checks user’s current zipcode”
  end
end
```</p>

<p>Again, the failure messages and description are optional blocks. The match block is obviously mandatory. So now that we have our new matcher, let’s check out what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h1 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h1>

<p><code>RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|</code></p>

<p>The <code>define</code> method, extended from the DSL module, does the following:</p>

<p>``` ruby define.rb RSpec::Matchers::DSL#define
def define(name, &amp;declarations)
  matcher_template = RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher.new(name, &amp;declarations)
  define_method name do |<em>expected|    # =&gt; expected for us is the var zipcode
    matcher = matcher_template.for_expected(</em>expected)
    matcher.matcher_execution_context = @matcher_execution_context ||= self
    matcher
  end
end</p>

<h1 id="name--beinzipcode">name = be_in_zipcode</h1>
<p>```</p>

<p>The second line setting <code>matcher_template</code> initializes an <code>RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher</code> object which stores the method name and the declarations block.</p>

<p><code>define_method</code> then creates the <code>be_in_zipcode</code> method. The next line’s <code>for_expected(*expected)</code> method sets the zipcode as the expected value and your failure messages/description from the matcher template in the second line. The messages and description are stored in the @messages attribute hash.</p>

<p>The next line I’m not sure about since <code>matcher_execution_context</code> refers to an attribute accessor. I don’t see it in the Matcher module either. Any insight here would be great!</p>

<p>Moving onto the last piece: the match block.</p>

<p><code>ruby
  match do |friend|
    friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
  end
</code></p>

<p><code>RSpec::Match#match</code> stores the given block in <code>@match_block</code>, so essentially, <code>@match_block = friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)</code>. </p>

<p>Later, when you run your specs with the new matcher, the <code>match_block</code> will get called from the method <code>RSpec::Match#matches?</code>.</p>

<p><code>ruby matches?
def matches?(actual)
  @actual = actual
  if @expected_exception
    begin
      instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
      true
    rescue @expected_exception
      false
    end
  else
    begin
      instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
    rescue Spec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError
      false
    end
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>And that’s it!</p>

<p>So if I were to run the original line, <code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code>, the following would happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>expect(dan)</code> returns an <code>RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget</code> object storing the object <code>dan</code>. Specifically: <code>=&gt; #&lt;RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget:0x007fbf511e4c78 @target=#&lt;User id: 1, name: dan&gt;&gt;</code></li>
  <li>the <code>to</code> method passes in <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> and calls a method called <code>handle_matcher</code>…</li>
  <li>… which checks if <code>be_in_zipcode</code> has been defined as a matcher.</li>
  <li>Since we’ve defined <code>be_in_zipcode</code>, <code>matches?</code> gets called our block, which we saw above.</li>
  <li><code>handle_matcher</code> then figures out how to respond, given the messages you passed in when you defined the new matcher.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s our deep dive into RSpec’s Custom Matchers. Again, feedback always welcome. Hope you enjoyed the complexity as much as I did! :)</p>

    <id>http://danielchangNYC.github.io/blog/2014/01/13/tdd1-ActiveRecordEqualityRogue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85629/1887574-rogue1.gif" title="Rogue" >
Almost done with my model specs! I ran into a couple of interesting problems that I posted on Stack Overflow, one of which I’ll cover briefly below. Oh yeah, and Rogue! I’ll explain that in the last section of this post.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-i-ran-into-from-my-stackoverflow-post1">The problem I ran into (from my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21102549/why-is-the-where-query-in-rails-returning-a-different-object">StackOverflow post</a>)</h2>

<p><em>If you just read the whole post, skip to the last section of this blog post.</em></p>

<p>I’m testing chats between users in my app. I’m using RSpec and FactoryGirl</p>

<p>The test that’s not passing:</p>

<p><code>ruby chat_spec.rb
it "creates a chat if one does not exist" do
  bob = create(:user, username: "bob")
  dan = create(:user, username: "dan")
  new_chat = Chat.create(user_id: dan.id, chatted_user_id: bob.id)
  expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)
end
</code></p>

<p>The failure message says:</p>

<p>``` sh
Failure/Error: expect(Chat.where(“chatted_user_id = ?”, bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)</p>

<p>expected #<chat:70120833243920> =&gt; #&lt;Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3&gt;
        got #<chat:70120833276240> =&gt; #&lt;Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3&gt;</chat:70120833276240></chat:70120833243920></p>

<p>Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,
   but expected and actual are not the same object. Use
   <code>expect(actual).to eq(expected)</code> if you don’t care about
   object identity in this example.
```</p>

<p>Why is my query returning a different object id?</p>

<h3 id="answer-from-simone-carletti-on-stackoverflow">Answer from Simone Carletti on StackOverflow</h3>

<p>equal checks object identity. The objects you are testing are two objects (instances) referencing the same record, but they are actually different objects from a Ruby virtual machine point of view.</p>

<p>You should use
<code>ruby
expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to eq(new_chat)
</code>
To better understand the problem, look at the following example</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :001 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320944040 
2.0.0-p353 :002 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320962820 
</code>
Here I’m creating two identical strings. They are identical, but not equal because they are actually two different objects.</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :008 &gt; "foo" == "foo"
 =&gt; true 
2.0.0-p353 :009 &gt; "foo".equal? "foo"
 =&gt; false 
</code></p>

<p>That’s the same issue affecting your test. equal checks if two objects are actually the same at the object_id level. But what you really want to know is if they are the same record.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-happening-under-the-hood">So what’s happening under the hood?</h2>

<p>The “where” query returns an array of objects matching the query, and those objects must be Active Record objects that just handle the data. If I make another query, Active Record must be creating another set of objects to handle each row of data.</p>

<p>I wanted to confirm this before throwing it out on the web as “fact”, so here’s what an Active Record object is from <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Martin Fowler himself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of an Active Record object sort of like Rogue (see above). For those of you who don’t remember, Rogue absorbs the memories and abilities of any person she touches.</p>

<p><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/25cd14bae1b207202d0ee9b56b475409/tumblr_mzd6fjLYmf1sqhdy2o1_1280.png" width="480" title="Comic Picture Rogue’s Powers" ></p>

<p>Similarly (sorta), an Active Record objects takes the data (memories) of a certain row and then takes on the behavior (abilities) of the object type matching the table name.</p>

<p>Ok, so that was really just an excuse to get Rogue somewhere on my blog. While I’m at it, here’s one of her destroying Ororo (Storm).</p>

<p><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b310/RogueX18/Rogue%20Absorptions/UncannyX-Men158Storm.jpg" title="Rogue and Storm Picture" ></p>

<p>So there you have it! Moral of the story: generally remember to use eq to test equivalence in RSpec with ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Oh, and here’s a <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/2-0/docs/matchers/equality-matchers">bonus resource: equal, eql, eq, and ==</a> in RSpec.</p>

<p>My friend told me about the job she left before coming to the Flatiron School and one of her responsibilities looked a bit like this:</p>

<p>What. A. Nightmare. There should be a -phobia for this.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong – I’m sure this could be pretty efficient if the scope of the UX is very small, or you don’t know-how to implement TDD yet. However, how can you be sure your site won’t expand, or why not learn how to use a gem like Capybara to save you time in the future? Used in conjuction with Guard, you could really save some serious time while coding!</p>

<h2 id="tdd-reason-2-code-confidence">TDD Reason 2: Code Confidence</h2>

<p>Now that I’ve had a bit more experience writing web apps (still without TDD), I’ve had the pleasure of seeing them grow and change throughout development. On the other hand, everytime I implemented a new feature, I had less and less confidence that the rest of my code base would work fine. At some point, the prospect of a new feature started feeling like a laundry list or the guarantee of a new bug. Testing will certainly help me find bugs as I introduce them, and therefore boost my confidence in in my code.</p>

<h2 id="tdd-reason-3-thinking-before-doing">TDD Reason 3: Thinking Before Doing</h2>

<p>Writing tests before writing production code forces you to clearly iterate what it is you want your application to do before you start coding. Ideally, you want your tests to last as long as possible as well, so it will force you to make important decisions about design as well. The prospect of having well thought-out code with lasting design excites me! I’ve had several experiences already of trying to refactor poorly designed code and it’s quite painful.</p>

<h2 id="my-next-steps">My Next Steps</h2>

<p>I’ve decided to begin my TDD exploration by refactoring my first app, Little Red Wagon (LRW). My current reads are Aaron Sumner’s book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz. I’m about 30% through each book right now and have written a few model specs already for LRW. I’ve decided not to use Factory Girl since it will slow down testing and Rails’ built-in fixtures are satisfactory for what I currently have. In any case, the grand plan is to get some hands-on practice writing tests using the TDD book first and then taking on the much larger challenge of redesigning my code base. Thanks for reading, and more updates to come on TDD!</p>
