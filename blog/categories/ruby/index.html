  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/04/24/set-intersection/">Set Intersection: An Unlikely but Elegant Solution, Plus BONUS!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>While working on the <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School pre-work</a> progress-tracker, I kept finding myself feeling uncomfortable with the <code>topic_complete?</code> and <code>add_lesson</code> methods below.</p>

<h1>Code Smell: <code>topic_complete?</code> and <code>add_lesson</code></h1>

<p>``` ruby
class Progress &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :topic
  serialize :completed_lessons, Array</p>

<p>  def topic_complete?</p>

<pre><code>topic.total_lessons == completed_lessons.length
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :progresses
  serialize :lesson_order, Array</p>

<p>  def add_lesson(lesson)</p>

<pre><code>lesson_order &lt;&lt; lesson.id
total_lessons += 1
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h1>Why The Code Is Smelly</h1>

<p><code>add_lesson</code> felt brittle. A new coder on this project has to know to add lessons using this method; the design is therefore NOT transparent. There is also a duplication of data: the <code>total_lessons</code> attribute and the length of the <code>lesson_order</code> array should always be the same, so why do we need <code>total_lessons</code>? The code therefore violates the DRY principle.</p>

<p><code>topic_complete?</code> has another host of what-if situations. Consider the possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>An admin removes lessons from the topic. <code>topic_complete?</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>An admin replaces a lesson in the topic. <code>topic_complete?</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
<li><code>total_lessons</code> doesn&rsquo;t get updated using <code>add_lesson</code>. See above.</li>
</ul>


<p>I needed a way to actually compare what was in the two arrays, <code>completed_lessons</code> and <code>lesson_order</code>.</p>

<h1>An Unlikely But Elegant Solution</h1>

<p>I considered iterating through <code>lesson_order</code> and comparing with <code>completed_lessons</code>, but this seemed cumbersome; &ldquo;There must be an easier way,&rdquo; thought Daniel.</p>

<p>Then it hit me: this is a <strong>set intersection</strong> problem. (Duh, it&rsquo;s in the title!)</p>

<p>Set theory review: The intersection of two sets is the set of all common elements. Luckily, Ruby class Array has such a method which can be used like an operator: <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<h1>Solution 1 => #fail</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Array.html#method-i-26">&amp; operator</a> is called the set intersection operator.</p>

<p><code>ruby example
[ 1, 1, 3, 5 ] &amp; [ 1, 2, 3 ]    #=&gt; [ 1, 3 ]
</code></p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def topic_complete?
  completed_lessons &amp; topic.lesson_order == topic.lesson_order
end
</code></p>

<p>&hellip;which failed.</p>

<h1>Why Solution 1 Failed</h1>

<p>``` ruby irb-fiddling
lesson_order = [3, 2, 5]
completed_lessons = [5, 2, 3]</p>

<p>lesson_order &amp; completed_lessons
   # => [3, 2, 5]</p>

<p>completed_lessons &amp; lesson_order
   # => [5, 2, 3]</p>

<p>completed_lessons &amp; lesson_order == lesson_order
   # => false
```</p>

<p>Note: <code>&amp;</code> ignores doubles.</p>

<p>``` ruby
a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
b = [2, 2, 2]</p>

<p>a &amp; b
  # => [2]</p>

<p>b &amp; a
  # => [2]
```</p>

<h1>Solution 2: o(^_^)b</h1>

<p><code>ruby
def topic_complete?
  topic.lesson_order &amp; completed_lessons == topic.lesson_order
end
</code>
&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; thought Daniel.</p>

<h1>BONUS: How Does <code>#&amp;</code> Work?</h1>

<p>I took a a deep dive into Ruby source code to figure this one out.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the code in C.</p>

<p>``` c
 static VALUE
rb_ary_and(VALUE ary1, VALUE ary2)
{</p>

<pre><code>VALUE hash, ary3, v;
st_table *table;
st_data_t vv;
long i;

ary2 = to_ary(ary2);
ary3 = rb_ary_new();
if (RARRAY_LEN(ary2) == 0) return ary3;
hash = ary_make_hash(ary2);
table = rb_hash_tbl_raw(hash);

for (i=0; i&lt;RARRAY_LEN(ary1); i++) {
    v = RARRAY_AREF(ary1, i);
    vv = (st_data_t)v;
    if (st_delete(table, &amp;vv, 0)) {
        rb_ary_push(ary3, v);
    }
}
ary_recycle_hash(hash);

return ary3;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve never read or written C in my life, but with the help of the <a href="http://rxr.whitequark.org/mri/ident">MRI Identifier Search</a>, I was able to piece together what this does.</p>

<p>The key to understanding this is in the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p><code>ary1</code> and <code>ary2</code> represent the arrays for which we&rsquo;re finding the intersection. <code>ary3</code> is what the function <code>rb_ary_and</code> returns.</p>

<p>v represents <code>ary1[i]</code>, in Ruby-speak.
vv is somehow tied to that value.</p>

<p><code>st_delete</code> returns 1 if <code>vv</code> was successfully deleted from <code>table</code>, which really refers to <code>ary2</code>, and 0 if it wasn&rsquo;t found. If it gets deleted, then that means <code>ary2</code> must have had an element in common; push that element into <code>ary3</code>.</p>

<h1>So how efficient is this method?</h1>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, <code>ary1</code> and <code>ary2</code> are giant arrays with completely disparate elements, requiring the algorithm to compare all elements of <code>ary2</code> with all elements of <code>ary1</code>. Given there are <em>x</em> elements in <code>ary1</code> and <em>y</em> elements in <code>ary2</code>, this would produce a O(x*y).</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/04/08/tdd3-TestingHooks/">Testing Rails Callbacks: A Step in the Right Direction</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Anyone who&rsquo;s worked with tightly-coupled models in rails will likely know the pain of tracing the stack for an error triggered from a callback method. Such painful experiences have led developers to come to a consensus on general rules like <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1658-the-only-acceptable-use-for-callbacks-in-rails-ever/">&ldquo;Use a callback only when the logic refers to state internal to the object&rdquo;</a>, according to Jonathan Wallace. More on this topic by Samuel Mullen in a great blogpost, <a href="http://www.samuelmullen.com/2013/05/the-problem-with-rails-callbacks/">The Problem with Rails Callbacks</a>.</p>

<p>The following post revolves around an <code>Invitation</code> model I wrote with my team mates and then later debated the callback to use.</p>

<p>The <code>Invitation</code> model generates a unique token which it uses to identify users who have clicked on a registration link.</p>

<p>The callback I chose to use first was <code>after_initialize</code> because an <code>invite</code> object must always have a <code>token</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation.rb
class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  after initialize :add_token #NOTE my syntax highlighter dislikes the underscore. see below.</p>

<p>  def add_unique_token</p>

<pre><code>self.token = Tokenizer.Generate
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <code>after initialize</code> above should be <code>after_initialize</code>. For some reason my syntax highlighting plugin doesn&rsquo;t like the underscore in the correct version.</p>

<p>The associated test:</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it &ldquo;generates a random token on initialize&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>invite = Invitation.new
expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>However, another team mate suggested using <code>before_create</code> instead.</p>

<p>His model and test:</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation.rb
class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  before_create :add_token</p>

<p>  def add_unique_token</p>

<pre><code>self.token = Tokenizer.generate
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it &ldquo;generates a random token before create&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>invite = Invitation.new
expect(invite.token).to be_nil
invite.save
expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>Why does this subtle change matter?</h3>

<p>First, <strong>using <code>after_initialize</code> could produce a false positive.</strong> While the <code>after_initialize</code> test does exactly what the <code>it</code> statement says, there&rsquo;s a chance that we may miss, say, a validation error that happens before <code>save</code>. This test would pass, and so would the validations, but for some reason you might find that your invitations aren&rsquo;t working properly. <code>after_initialize</code> allows us to omit saving from the test, which one could generally assume is always desired given that callbacks should only &ldquo;refer to state internal to an object&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>if you&rsquo;re testing a callback that affects the internal state of an object, we must test for a state-change.</strong> Using <code>after_initialize</code>, we can tell that a new invite has a token. However, we cannot say that we&rsquo;ve tested the non-presence and the presence of the token. The pivotal point again is around <code>#save</code>. <code>#save</code> triggers the change and we can say with certainty that we&rsquo;ve not only seen a &ldquo;zero to one&rdquo; change happen, but that the change has persisted in our database.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/scottadhoc/status/453917228648640512">Twitter comment</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/scottadhoc">@scottadhoc</a>: &ldquo;what happens if you load that record from the db into a new object and then assert on that field?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good point! If I understand your suggestion correctly, here&rsquo;s how I might refactor the after_initialize version of the spec:</p>

<p>``` ruby invitation_spec.rb
describe Invitation do
  it &ldquo;generates a random token #after_initialize&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>invite = Invitation.new
expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
invite.save!
expect(invite.token).not_to be_nil
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>This way, we can make sure that the data persisted. While this works, my feeling is that the implication of testing after_initialize allows one to omit the persistence part. I certainly fell into that trap and wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I forget again while testing an after_initialize callback.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you use <code>after_initialize</code> with the underscore in a block of code in <code>Octopress</code>, your blog will refuse to generate. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/15/tdd2-RSpecMatchers/">RSpec Custom Matchers: A Deep Dive</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <h1>What&rsquo;s a Matcher?</h1>

<p><code>expect(dan.current_zipcode).to eq(10002)</code></p>

<p>In the line above, the <code>matcher</code> is the method <code>eq</code> because RSpec will check to see if the value of <code>dan.current_zipcode</code> matches <code>10002</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that this was a line you wrote for as part of a test for a location tracking app. You want your code to be as clear as possible for collaborators or even for your future self.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it sound even better if you could write this?</p>

<p><code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code></p>

<p>This requires <code>be_in_zipcode</code> to be a method in <code>RSpec</code>&rsquo;s matcher library. I&rsquo;m going to briefly explain how to create this new matcher, but for alternate explanations, check out the <a href="https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Custom-Matchers">Rspec Github Wiki</a> and Chapter 7 of Aaron Sumner&rsquo;s <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>My intention is not to write another Matcher tutorial (though this might inevitably happen). After reading Sumner&rsquo;s chapter, I could imagine how matchers were created but ultimately, I felt a bit uncertain. With a little bit of <code>Pry</code> magic and doc-digging, I think I&rsquo;ve finally put most of the puzzle together which I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing below! Constructive feedback and deeper insights are always welcome. :)</p>

<h1>Match-Maker, Match-Maker, Make Me a Match!</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write some code so that we can use the method <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> from above.</p>

<p>General syntax at bare minimum first:
``` ruby syntax.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :new_matcher_name do |expected|
  match do |actual|</p>

<pre><code># Lines of code you want this matcher to run
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  #optional description and failure message definition blocks
end</p>

<h1>From the describe block:</h1>

<h1>expect(actual).to matcher_method(expected)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>NOTE: Store your matcher files in <code>spec/support/matchers/</code> and require them in <code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code> with the following line:</p>

<p><code>Dir[File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/support/**/*.rb"].each {|f| require f}</code></p>

<p>Now onto our example:
``` ruby be_in_zipcode.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|
  match do |friend|</p>

<pre><code>friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # Optional failure messages
  failure_message_for_should do |actual|</p>

<pre><code>"expected friend to be in zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  failure_message_for_should_not do |actual|</p>

<pre><code>"expected friend not to be in zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # Optional method description
  description do</p>

<pre><code>"checks user's current zipcode"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Again, the failure messages and description are optional blocks. The match block is obviously mandatory. So now that we have our new matcher, let&rsquo;s check out what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h1>Under the hood</h1>

<p><code>RSpec::Matchers.define :be_in_zipcode do |zipcode|</code></p>

<p>The <code>define</code> method, extended from the DSL module, does the following:</p>

<p>``` ruby define.rb RSpec::Matchers::DSL#define
def define(name, &amp;declarations)
  matcher_template = RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher.new(name, &amp;declarations)
  define_method name do |*expected|    # => expected for us is the var zipcode</p>

<pre><code>matcher = matcher_template.for_expected(*expected)
matcher.matcher_execution_context = @matcher_execution_context ||= self
matcher
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>name = be_in_zipcode</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The second line setting <code>matcher_template</code> initializes an <code>RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher</code> object which stores the method name and the declarations block.</p>

<p><code>define_method</code> then creates the <code>be_in_zipcode</code> method. The next line&rsquo;s <code>for_expected(*expected)</code> method sets the zipcode as the expected value and your failure messages/description from the matcher template in the second line. The messages and description are stored in the @messages attribute hash.</p>

<p>The next line I&rsquo;m not sure about since <code>matcher_execution_context</code> refers to an attribute accessor. I don&rsquo;t see it in the Matcher module either. Any insight here would be great!</p>

<p>Moving onto the last piece: the match block.</p>

<p>``` ruby
  match do |friend|</p>

<pre><code>friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p><code>RSpec::Match#match</code> stores the given block in <code>@match_block</code>, so essentially, <code>@match_block = friend.in_zipcode?(zipcode)</code>.</p>

<p>Later, when you run your specs with the new matcher, the <code>match_block</code> will get called from the method <code>RSpec::Match#matches?</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby matches?
def matches?(actual)
  @actual = actual
  if @expected_exception</p>

<pre><code>begin
  instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
  true
rescue @expected_exception
  false
end
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>begin
  instance_exec(actual, &amp;@match_block)
rescue Spec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError
  false
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>So if I were to run the original line, <code>expect(dan).to be_in_zipcode(10002)</code>, the following would happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>expect(dan)</code> returns an <code>RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget</code> object storing the object <code>dan</code>. Specifically: <code>=&gt; #&lt;RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationTarget:0x007fbf511e4c78 @target=#&lt;User id: 1, name: dan&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li>the <code>to</code> method passes in <code>be_in_zipcode(10002)</code> and calls a method called <code>handle_matcher</code>&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; which checks if <code>be_in_zipcode</code> has been defined as a matcher.</li>
<li>Since we&rsquo;ve defined <code>be_in_zipcode</code>, <code>matches?</code> gets called our block, which we saw above.</li>
<li><code>handle_matcher</code> then figures out how to respond, given the messages you passed in when you defined the new matcher.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s our deep dive into RSpec&rsquo;s Custom Matchers. Again, feedback always welcome. Hope you enjoyed the complexity as much as I did! :)</p>

Almost done with my model specs! I ran into a couple of interesting problems that I posted on Stack Overflow, one of which I&rsquo;ll cover briefly below. Oh yeah, and Rogue! I&rsquo;ll explain that in the last section of this post.</p>

<h2>The problem I ran into (from my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21102549/why-is-the-where-query-in-rails-returning-a-different-object">StackOverflow post</a>)</h2>

<p><em>If you just read the whole post, skip to the last section of this blog post.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m testing chats between users in my app. I&rsquo;m using RSpec and FactoryGirl</p>

<p>The test that&rsquo;s not passing:</p>

<p><code>ruby chat_spec.rb
it "creates a chat if one does not exist" do
  bob = create(:user, username: "bob")
  dan = create(:user, username: "dan")
  new_chat = Chat.create(user_id: dan.id, chatted_user_id: bob.id)
  expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)
end
</code></p>

<p>The failure message says:</p>

<p>``` sh
Failure/Error: expect(Chat.where(&ldquo;chatted_user_id = ?&rdquo;, bob.id).first).to equal(new_chat)</p>

<p>   expected #&lt;Chat:70120833243920> => #<Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3></p>

<pre><code>    got #&lt;Chat:70120833276240&gt; =&gt; #&lt;Chat id: 2, user_id: 2, chatted_user_id: 3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>   Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,
   but expected and actual are not the same object. Use
   <code>expect(actual).to eq(expected)</code> if you don&rsquo;t care about
   object identity in this example.
```</p>

<p>Why is my query returning a different object id?</p>

<h3>Answer from Simone Carletti on StackOverflow</h3>

<p>equal checks object identity. The objects you are testing are two objects (instances) referencing the same record, but they are actually different objects from a Ruby virtual machine point of view.</p>

<p>You should use
<code>ruby
expect(Chat.where("chatted_user_id = ?", bob.id).first).to eq(new_chat)
</code>
To better understand the problem, look at the following example</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :001 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320944040
2.0.0-p353 :002 &gt; "foo".object_id
 =&gt; 70117320962820
</code>
Here I&rsquo;m creating two identical strings. They are identical, but not equal because they are actually two different objects.</p>

<p><code>
2.0.0-p353 :008 &gt; "foo" == "foo"
 =&gt; true
2.0.0-p353 :009 &gt; "foo".equal? "foo"
 =&gt; false
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the same issue affecting your test. equal checks if two objects are actually the same at the object_id level. But what you really want to know is if they are the same record.</p>

<h2>So what&rsquo;s happening under the hood?</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;where&rdquo; query returns an array of objects matching the query, and those objects must be Active Record objects that just handle the data. If I make another query, Active Record must be creating another set of objects to handle each row of data.</p>

<p>I wanted to confirm this before throwing it out on the web as &ldquo;fact&rdquo;, so here&rsquo;s what an Active Record object is from <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Martin Fowler himself</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think of an Active Record object sort of like Rogue (see above). For those of you who don&rsquo;t remember, Rogue absorbs the memories and abilities of any person she touches.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/25cd14bae1b207202d0ee9b56b475409/tumblr_mzd6fjLYmf1sqhdy2o1_1280.png">http://31.media.tumblr.com/25cd14bae1b207202d0ee9b56b475409/tumblr_mzd6fjLYmf1sqhdy2o1_1280.png</a>" width="480" title="Comic Picture Rogue&rsquo;s Powers" ></p>

<p>Similarly (sorta), an Active Record objects takes the data (memories) of a certain row and then takes on the behavior (abilities) of the object type matching the table name.</p>

<p>Ok, so that was really just an excuse to get Rogue somewhere on my blog. While I&rsquo;m at it, here&rsquo;s one of her destroying Ororo (Storm).</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b310/RogueX18/Rogue%20Absorptions/UncannyX-Men158Storm.jpg">http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b310/RogueX18/Rogue%20Absorptions/UncannyX-Men158Storm.jpg</a>" title="Rogue and Storm Picture" ></p>

<p>So there you have it! Moral of the story: generally remember to use eq to test equivalence in RSpec with ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/2-0/docs/matchers/equality-matchers">bonus resource: equal, eql, eq, and ==</a> in RSpec.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/12/tdd0-whyttd/">How and Why I Began Testing in Ruby on Rails</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Testing is one of those things that feels a bit like eating well or going to the gym. Since it&rsquo;s already ten days into the New Year and I have yet to commit to any resolutions, let this be it: no more will I make excuses for skipping testing.</p>

<p>What does this really mean to me though? Am I eating broccoli just because someone told me it&rsquo;s good for me? Here are three reasons that have driven me to make the change.</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 1: Manual Testing Sucks; TDD Saves Time</h2>

<p>My friend told me about the job she left before coming to the Flatiron School and one of her responsibilities looked a bit like this:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://blog.polarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-12.07.14-PM.png">http://blog.polarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-12.07.14-PM.png</a>"></p>

<p>What. A. Nightmare. There should be a -phobia for this.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &mdash; I&rsquo;m sure this could be pretty efficient if the scope of the UX is very small, or you don&rsquo;t know-how to implement TDD yet. However, how can you be sure your site won&rsquo;t expand, or why not learn how to use a gem like Capybara to save you time in the future? Used in conjuction with Guard, you could really save some serious time while coding!</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 2: Code Confidence</h2>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had a bit more experience writing web apps (still without TDD), I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of seeing them grow and change throughout development. On the other hand, everytime I implemented a new feature, I had less and less confidence that the rest of my code base would work fine. At some point, the prospect of a new feature started feeling like a laundry list or the guarantee of a new bug. Testing will certainly help me find bugs as I introduce them, and therefore boost my confidence in in my code.</p>

<h2>TDD Reason 3: Thinking Before Doing</h2>

<p>Writing tests before writing production code forces you to clearly iterate what it is you want your application to do before you start coding. Ideally, you want your tests to last as long as possible as well, so it will force you to make important decisions about design as well. The prospect of having well thought-out code with lasting design excites me! I&rsquo;ve had several experiences already of trying to refactor poorly designed code and it&rsquo;s quite painful.</p>

<h2>My Next Steps</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to begin my TDD exploration by refactoring my first app, Little Red Wagon (LRW). My current reads are Aaron Sumner&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> by Sandi Metz. I&rsquo;m about 30% through each book right now and have written a few model specs already for LRW. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Factory Girl since it will slow down testing and Rails' built-in fixtures are satisfactory for what I currently have. In any case, the grand plan is to get some hands-on practice writing tests using the TDD book first and then taking on the much larger challenge of redesigning my code base. Thanks for reading, and more updates to come on TDD!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/05/big-o/">Big O Notation</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Big O notation might look something like this: O(log N)</p>

<p><code>
N = number of input data
O( ) = function notation for Big O (just tells you we're using Big O notation)
log N = the function that describes the efficiency of the procedure or algorithm as N grows bigger and bigger
</code></p>

<p>Programmers use Big O Notation as a way to express how efficient an algorithm or procedure is at performing its designated task (e.g. sorting, searching). The function tells us the maximum number of &ldquo;actions&rdquo; it will take for the algorithm to achieve its goal, given N data.</p>

<h2>Example 1: O(N)</h2>

<p>O(N) is the linear case. Given 10 data, the worst-case scenario is that it will take 10 &ldquo;actions&rdquo; to search for a target, or sort the data, or whatever the goal of the algorithm is. Given 100 data, it will take 100 actions. Given 2000 data, it will take 2000 actions. Given N data, it will take N actions.</p>

<p>A real life example would be if you were looking for a book on your friend&rsquo;s bookshelf.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5PudbMqUjng/TR5Cu-fq4ZI/AAAAAAAAACk/t_oojdxP-c8/s400/harrypotter.jpg">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5PudbMqUjng/TR5Cu-fq4ZI/AAAAAAAAACk/t_oojdxP-c8/s400/harrypotter.jpg</a>" width="400"></p>

<p>Lets say you want your program to find any given book. You could tell the program to start checking books one by one from the left. If you wanted Harry Potter 3, it would only take 3 actions (or tries) because it&rsquo;s the third book in. However, Big O tells us the worst-case scenario. What book would cause the algorithm to take the most possible actions? Harry Potter 7 &mdash; it&rsquo;s the last book so the algorithm would have to run all 7 times. Given 7 books, it took the algorithm 7 actions / tries to find the book <em>in the worst case scenario</em>.</p>

<p>What if we ran this algorithm on 10 books? The worst case would take all 10 tries. How about 1,000,000 books? It would take 1 million tries.</p>

<p>So, TL;DR &mdash; O(N) tells us that given N data, it will take an algorithm N actions / tries to accomplish a task.</p>

<h2>Example 2: O(1)</h2>

<p>What does O(1) tell us? The function inside is simply &ldquo;1&rdquo;. This means that no matter what number N is, it will always accomplish the task in 1 try. It represents the most efficient algorithm possible.</p>

<p>Does this exist? Sure it does! But it might not give you exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for. Here&rsquo;s an algorithm that can be described with O(1).</p>

<p><code>ruby
def efficient_but_useless
  return true
end
</code></p>

<p>TL;DR algorithms with O(1) always finish in 1 try.</p>

<h2>Example 3: O(N<sup>2</sup>) or any higher exponent</h2>

<p>Is this an efficient algorithm? In other words, if I input a large amount of data for N, what does that tell me about the algorithm? If I input N=1, then no matter what, it will take 1 try. But if I put in N=10, then it will take 10<sup>2</sup> = 100 actions / tries to complete the algorithm (worst case scenario). Imagine if the exponent were higher, or if N were higher. Then the algorithm would be super inefficient!</p>

<p>What kinds of algorithms would have O(N<sup>2</sup>)? Simply put, algorithms with nested loops usually exhibit this behavior. If you have to run a procedure on each item, and each item has to check itself against every other item in some way, then worst case is that you run the procedure N<sup>2</sup> times. In other words, it takes N<sup>2</sup> actions.</p>

<h2>Example 4: O(log N)</h2>

<p>This time the function is logarithmic.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://image.tutorvista.com/content/feed/tvcs/img64.gif">http://image.tutorvista.com/content/feed/tvcs/img64.gif</a>"></p>

<p>Imagine that the x-axis represents N, how much input data you have, and the y-axis tells us how many actions or tries it takes the algorithm to finish (worst case scenario, as usual). As N grows larger, the number of tries grows, but slowly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try calculating a few examples. Keep in mind that when programmers write log N, it refers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1569702/is-big-ologn-log-base-e">log base 2</a>. Also, since the number of actions has to be a whole number, if you get a decimal, the rule of thumb is to round up. So given 10 data, it will take log(10) = 3.32 which rounds up to 4 actions, max. This isn&rsquo;t that much more efficient than O(N), but what if N=1,000,000? It would take your algorithm log(1000000) = 19.93 which rounds up to 20 tries, max. For 1000000 data, that&rsquo;s pretty efficient!</p>

<p>When would we use a logarithmic function to describe the efficiency of an algorithm? One example is the binary search. The binary search algorithm finds a target value within a set of sorted data by repeating the process below until you&rsquo;re left with one value.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the middle value. If there is more than one, take the higher value.</li>
<li>Compare the target value with the middle value. If it&rsquo;s equal, then we&rsquo;ve found the target. Otherwise, if the target > middle value, then eliminate all values to the left of the middle (lower than the middle); we know the target is in the half with greater values. If the target is &lt;= middle, eliminate the right.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 on the remaining side. Continue until you are left with one value; this is your target.</li>
</ol>


<p>So let&rsquo;s say this is your data, and you&rsquo;re looking for the value, 4.</p>

<p><code>ruby
data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 4
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Find the middle value. There are 10 values, thus two middles. Take the higher: 5.</li>
</ol>


<p>``` ruby first_action
middle = 5
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]; [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</p>

<h1>left side = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</h1>

<h1>right side = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</h1>

<p>```</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compare target with middle. Is it equal to 4? No. Since target &lt;= middle (4 &lt;= 5), eliminate the right side.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 on the left side. We&rsquo;ll keep doing this until we find the target value, 4.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>``` ruby second_action
middle = 2
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</p>

<h1>left side = [0, 1]</h1>

<h1>right side = [2, 3, 4]</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Check: is target = middle? No. So onto step 2, compare: target > middle (4 > 2). Use the right side.</p>

<p>``` ruby third_action
middle = 3
[2, 3, 4]</p>

<h1>left side = <a href="http://pointlessprogramming.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/what-in-the-hell-is-big-o/">2</a></h1>

<h1>right side = [3, 4]</h1>

<p>```
target = middle? No
So compare again. target > middle (4 > 3). Use the right side.</p>

<p>``` ruby fourth_action
middle = 4  # note, we always take the higher of two as the middle for an even set.
[3, 4]</p>

<h1>left side = <a href="http://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2010/12/07/comp-sci-101-big-o-notation/">3</a></h1>

<h1>right side = <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">4</a></h1>

<p>```
Target = middle? Yes. We&rsquo;ve found the target and it took 4 tries!</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s make sense of this as a logarithmic function: O(log N). We saw above that the calculations work, but why is it log base 2, and why log? If you think of logs as the inverse of exponents, and exponents as repeated multiplication, then logs are repeated division. Where are we dividing in the above procedure? Every step! We&rsquo;re cutting each set in half over and over again until we reach the target, hence repeated division. Why is it log base 2? Log base 2 simply means that we keep dividing by 2, which makes sense because we&rsquo;re cutting the data set in half.</p>

<p>I chose the target number 4 in the binary search method above because it represents the worst case scenario for a set of 10 data. It took 4 tries / actions, and log(10), again with an assumed base 2 since we&rsquo;re in the world of programming, gives us 3.32 which rounds up to 4. Tada!</p>

<p>If you want to see the binary search method or linear methods in action, here&rsquo;s a rather straight-forward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVCJj642n4">video</a> demonstrating what I showed above.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Resources</h2>

<p>I hope that this post helps clarify big O notation for those of you who are brand new to the idea. A few other resources I feel are really well-done: this <a href="http://pointlessprogramming.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/what-in-the-hell-is-big-o/">visual, real-world explanation</a> and this <a href="http://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2010/12/07/comp-sci-101-big-o-notation/">much more technical explanation</a>. I didn&rsquo;t include code in this post because these algorithms are all solved problems already and with some Google sleuthing, you will repos full of them in a multitude of languages. One more resource I like is the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">big o cheat-sheet</a>.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/10/23/throw-raise/">Ruby 'Exceptional' Knowledge</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <h2>Foreward</h2>

<p>Most of us have encountered the methods <code>raise</code>, <code>rescue</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>throw</code>, and <code>break</code> in Ruby. We can generally understand what&rsquo;s going on when we read code that uses it, but what exactly is the difference between them all? Here&rsquo;s a quick guide plus some fun and useful facts.</p>

<h1>If you remember just one thing&hellip;</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>raise</code> and <code>rescue</code> are used for handling errors <em>only</em></li>
<li><code>throw</code> and <code>catch</code> are used in order to terminate execution early when no other work is needed. <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/07/12/throw-catch-raise-rescue-im-so-confused/">source</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Raise and Rescue</h1>

<p><code>raise</code> and <code>rescue</code> are used exclusively for handling errors. By default, raising an error will exit the program.
``` ruby exception.rb
def test_rescue
  puts &ldquo;This is before raise&rdquo;
  raise &ldquo;Raised an error&rdquo;
  puts &ldquo;This is after raise. It won&rsquo;t ever run.&rdquo;
end
test_rescue</p>

<h1>=> This is before raise</h1>

<h1>=> test.rb:3:in `test_rescue': Raised an error (RuntimeError)</h1>

<p>  from test.rb:9:in <code>&lt;main&gt;'
```
This happens unless there is a</code>rescue` statement which will run in case of an exception.</p>

<p>``` ruby exception.rb
def test_rescue
  puts &ldquo;This is before raise&rdquo;
  raise &ldquo;Raised an error&rdquo;
  puts &ldquo;This is after raise. It won&rsquo;t ever run.&rdquo;
  rescue
  puts &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rescued!&rdquo;
end
test_rescue</p>

<h1>=> This is before raise</h1>

<h1>=> I&rsquo;m rescued!</h1>

<p><code>
The above Ruby code can be rewritten like so:
</code> ruby exception.rb
def test_rescue
  puts &ldquo;This is before raise&rdquo;
  raise &ldquo;Raised an error&rdquo;
  puts &ldquo;This is after raise. It won&rsquo;t ever run.&rdquo;
  rescue Exception => e
  puts e
end
test_rescue</p>

<h1>=> This is before raise</h1>

<h1>=> Raised an error</h1>

<p>```
Ruby has many different types of exceptions (see <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Exception.html">documentation</a>).
Raise takes up to three parameters:
 * the exception type
 * an error message
 * an array of callback information.</p>

<p>All three are optional and Ruby knows that if you only pass in a string that it&rsquo;s the message. Usually you don&rsquo;t set the last parameter since <code>Kernel#caller</code> automatically creates that array.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of valid <code>raise</code> statements.
<code>ruby Message parameter given
raise "This is an error"
</code>
<code>ruby Error and Message parameters
raise StandardError "Most error subclasses extend StandardError"
</code></p>

<h3>Exceptional Ruby</h3>

<p>Exception is the root of Ruby&rsquo;s exception hierarchy. It&rsquo;s the class from which all Exceptions descend. It is king. This has a very interesting consequence.</p>

<p><code>rescue Exception</code> rescues from EVERYTHING, including syntax errors, load errors, and any of the following listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rescuing <code>Interrupt</code> prevents you from being able to CTRL+C out of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Rescuing <code>SignalException</code> prevents the program from responding correctly to signals. It will be unkillable, except with kill -9. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby">source</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>``` ruby
loop do
  begin</p>

<pre><code>eval dinosaurs ru1ez the pl@netz!!! ROArR{bark}[:ARF].ENV
</code></pre>

<p>  rescue Exception</p>

<pre><code>puts "What meteor?"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h1>Break, Catch, and Throw</h1>

<p><code>break</code>, <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code> are used in order to terminate execution early when no other work is needed. <code>break</code> leaves the <em>current</em> loop while the <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code> combination can be used to break out of <em>any number</em> of loops at one time.</p>

<p>``` ruby break example
array = [&ldquo;brainfuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;ruby&rdquo; &ldquo;befunge&rdquo;, &ldquo;python&rdquo;, &ldquo;perl&rdquo;]
array.each do |language|
  puts &ldquo;My favorite computer langauge is #{language}&rdquo;
  break
end</p>

<h1>=> &ldquo;My favorite computer langauge is brainfuck&rdquo;</h1>

<p><code>
</code> ruby hypothetical throw and catch example</p>

<h1>=> recipe_hash = {&hellip;}</h1>

<p>def show_recipe_for(recipe_name)
  recipe = catch(:recipe) {</p>

<pre><code>recipe_hash.each do |meal_type, dish_hash|
  dish_hash.each do |dish, dish_recipe|
    if recipe_name == dish_recipe
      throw :recipe, dish_recipe
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  }
end
<code>``
Notice that the two loops are enclosed in the</code>catch<code>block. This means that once the</code>throw<code>statement is executed, it will store the value of its second argument into</code>:recipe` and send it back to the catch statement. By doing so, it exits all the loops after finding the first recipe match. From there, the method finishes executing as normal.</p>

<p>Because my example is a bit contrived, I will post a real-life example from another <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/07/12/throw-catch-raise-rescue-im-so-confused/">blog</a> by rubyist Avdi Grimm.</p>

<p>``` ruby google search scraping example
def show_rank_for(target, query)
  rank = catch(:rank) {</p>

<pre><code>each_google_result_page(query, 6) do |page, page_index|
  each_google_result(page) do |result, result_index|
    if result.text.include?(target)
      throw :rank, (page_index * 10) + result_index
    end
  end
end
"&lt;not found&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  puts &ldquo;#{target} is ranked #{rank} for search &lsquo;#{query}&rsquo;&rdquo;
end
<code>``
Since loading pages over and over again can be an expensive process, the coder above uses a</code>throw<code>-</code>catch` to exit the loop when the first matching result is found.</p>

<h2>Throw, Catch and Sinatra</h2>

<p>An even more mind-blowing example from the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/07/12/throw-catch-raise-rescue-im-so-confused/">same blog post</a> reveals that Sinatra has a built-in catch for the <code>#last-modified</code> method. You might use this method to check a user&rsquo;s <em>cache</em> for what version of a certain page the user has on his/her machine. Why would you do this? Simple! In order to cut out any expensive and unnecessary processing. If the page in the cache is old, then you&rsquo;d update the page. Otherwise, just load from cache.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here&rsquo;s the simplified code Grimm posted to demonstrate.</p>

<p>``` ruby
def last_modified(time)
  response[&lsquo;Last-Modified&rsquo;] = time
  if request.env[&lsquo;HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE&rsquo;] > time</p>

<pre><code>throw :halt, response
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
<code>
When Ruby encounters the `throw`, it zips back up the call stack looking for a matching symbol, `:halt`. Where's the `catch` block though? It's clearly not in the same method as the `throw`. This means that it must be further up the stack. In other words, `#last_modified` was called within a `catch` block.
</code> ruby
catch (:halt) do
  # code
  last_modified(time) # => the throw in this method sends :halt up to the encapsulating catch
  # code
end
```</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/10/08/rails-presentation-post/">ActiveRecord</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I took a bit of a dive today and looked a Ruby on Rails <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aizatto/ruby-on-rails-48391">presentation</a>. Here&rsquo;s what I gleaned from looking through all the slides.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rails is a web application framework that allows your Ruby to interact with the web seamlessly. By &ldquo;interact with the web&rdquo;, I assume the presentation means &ldquo;interact with databases.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Rails implements a principle called &ldquo;MVC&rdquo; &mdash; Model View Controller. Rails seems to handle each task separately. I&rsquo;m going to focus on the Model, which uses ActiveRecord.</p></li>
<li><p>ActiveRecord is a Module that Rails uses to model and interact with databases. It makes database queries both simple and intuitive.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here are some concrete query comparisons between using SQLite3 versus Rails' ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>Assume we have a table called &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; each with a name, age, weight, and type. Each attribute would be a column, and each row would represent a different dog.</p>

<p><code>sql Table using SQLite3
CREATE TABLE dogs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT;
  age INTEGER;
  weight INTEGER;
  type TEXT
);
</code>
We can also imagine this as a class of Dog objects in Ruby. Here&rsquo;s how one might create the barebones structure in Ruby.
<code>ruby Dogs as objects of class Dog in Ruby
class Dog
  attr_accessor :id, :name, :age, :weight, :type
end
</code>
<code>ruby Table initialized using Rails' ActiveRecord
class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</code></p>

<p>See how simple that was? Now we can make queries on the table.</p>

<p><code>sql SQLite3 query for first dog in table
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE id=1;
</code>
<code>ruby Rails query for first dog in table
Dog.find(1)
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning! Check this out.</p>

<p><code>sql SQLite3 query appending conditions
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age=8 AND type="corgi";
</code>
<code>ruby Rails query appending same conditions
Dog.find_by_age_and_type 25, "corgi"
</code></p>

<p>It seems like ActiveRecord must use certain keywords like &lsquo;by&rsquo; and &lsquo;and&rsquo; in order to dynamically use the attribute names that the user inputs.</p>

<p>What is really beautiful though is the idea of &ldquo;configuration of convention&rdquo; that Rails implements in order to shorten the amount of code you need to write. Slides 42-44 of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aizatto/ruby-on-rails-48391">presentation</a>  gave a particularly good example of the idea. No wonder people love Rails!</p>

<p>The slides continue talking about the MVC</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/10/07/flatten-arrays/">Recursive Arrays</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>I feel a certain level of confidence declaring that every programmer has been in the situation where he/she has 10+ tabs open trying troubleshooting a problem and finally concludes, &ldquo;There must be an easier way.&rdquo; Or, if you&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;in the zone&rsquo; for long enough, you might start wondering what exactly got you in this troubleshooting hell to begin with.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share what I learned from one such experience.</p>

<h3>Context and Problem</h3>

<p>I was writing an automatic schedule-maker in Ruby. create_groups is a method that, takes an array of student names and returns an array of the students in a specified group sizes. The create_groups method also takes a parameter that allows you to specify a number of groups. The student groups should be randomized.</p>

<p>First, I defined the method create_groups, set up an array of grouped students that I can push groups into, and returned the value.</p>

<p><code>ruby
def create_groups(students, group_size, number_of_groups)
  groups = []  #=&gt; store the groups of students in this array
  # Implement magic.
  groups  #=&gt; Return groups
end
create_groups(students, 4, 20)
students = [.......] #=&gt; This array contains 41 student names. Check my Github Gist linked below for the array I used in the completed program.
</code></p>

<p>After considering several strategies, I decided that it would make the most sense sort the 40 students using what I dubbed the &ldquo;card dealing method&rdquo; &mdash; The first student goes to group 1, the second to group 2, the third to group 3, and so forth.</p>

<p>``` ruby
def create_groups(students, group_size, number_of_groups)
  groups = []
  normalized_list = normalize(students, group_size, number_of_groups)
  normalized_list.each_with_index do |name, i|</p>

<pre><code># This part will sort students using the "card-dealing method"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  groups
end
```</p>

<p>Since there are 20 groups of 4, I needed 80 students. On an abstract level, the number of students I need in order to sort (the &ldquo;desired length&rdquo;) is &ldquo;# of groups&rdquo; x &ldquo;# of students per group&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I decided to create another method which would normalize my list to this set amount.</p>

<p>The #normalize method will return an array of desired length by <em>replicating the students a number of times, and then slicing out the desired number of students from the replicated array.</em></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I came up with at first:
``` ruby
def create_groups(students, group_size, number_of_groups)
  #&hellip;folded this code for now&hellip;
end</p>

<p>def normalize(list_to_norm, group_size, number_of_groups)
  desired_length = group_size*number_of_groups
  new_list = list_to_norm
  while new_list.length &lt; desired_length</p>

<pre><code>new_list &lt;&lt; list_to_norm
new_list = new_list.flatten
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>When I ran this given a student array though, I received the following error:
<code>sh
rb24:`flatten': tried to flatten recursive array (ArgumentError)
</code></p>

<p>WAT? After many attempts at troubleshooting and searching the web for an answer, I decided to inspect what exactly I was trying to flatten.</p>

<p><code>ruby
def normalize(list_to_norm, group_size, number_of_groups)
  desired_length = group_size*number_of_groups
  new_list = list_to_norm
  new_list &lt;&lt; list_to_norm
  puts new_list
end
</code></p>

<p>The output was VERY telling. The <code>...</code> line below is just a placeholder for names 4 through 40.</p>

<p><code>sh
Name1
Name2
Name3
...
Name41
[...]
</code></p>

<p>The clue was in the <code>[...]</code>.</p>

<p>I then tried running <code>new_list.object_id</code> and <code>list_to_norm.object_id</code> and they turned out to be the same.</p>

<h3>A-ha!</h3>

<p>The <code>[...]</code> indicated that new_list is now a <em>recursive array</em>. More on recurive arrays <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10606734/what-are-recursive-arrays-good-for">here</a>.</p>

<p>As it turns out, my problem was in the 2nd line of my normalize method.</p>

<p><code>ruby
new_list = list_to_norm
</code>
This line of code sets the <code>new_list</code> variable to point at the exact same object as the <code>list_to_norm</code> method. So later, when I called <code>new_list &lt;&lt; list_to_norm</code>, I ended up pushing an Array object into itself. The image below</p>

<p>However, Ruby clearly didn&rsquo;t like this, and I suspect that it has to do with the way <code>Array.flatten</code> works. At the very least, we can conclude that <code>.flatten</code> can only flatten two different Array objects.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I learned in 40 minutes of head-banging against a figurative brick wall. I hope you learned something as well from this post!</p>
